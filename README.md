# Neuroradiology AI Assistant

This project is a Neuroradiology AI assistant designed to help medical professionals analyze medical images, interact with an AI for insights, and generate reports.

## Architecture Overview

The system comprises:
- A **Next.js frontend** for user interaction and API routes.
- **Pocketbase** for database and authentication.
- An **Ollama-compatible multimodal LLM** for AI-driven analysis.

All services are containerized using Docker.

## Project Status

Initializing project structure and setting up foundational services. 
There is some test data, including a non-related image for initial tests with multimodal reasoning. 
Dockerized Ollama is the current backend but planning future work to create more open ended connections (OpenAI, Gemini, other endpoints).
